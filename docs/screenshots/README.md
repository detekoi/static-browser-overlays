# Screenshots

This directory will contain screenshots of the overlays in action for documentation and preview purposes.

## Guidelines for Screenshots

When adding screenshots of overlays:

1. Capture at 1920x1080 resolution when possible
2. Show the overlay with game content to demonstrate how it looks in use
3. Include variations with different customization options
4. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `cozy-10-9-dark-theme.png`)

## Placeholder Images

Until real screenshots are added, this directory serves as a placeholder.

## Adding Your Own

If you've customized an overlay and want to share screenshots, please:

1. Follow the naming convention
2. Optimize images for web (PNG or JPEG format, reasonable file size)
3. Include a brief description in a pull request
